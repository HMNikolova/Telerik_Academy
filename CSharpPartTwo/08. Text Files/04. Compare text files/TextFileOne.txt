Stream is the natural way to transfer data in the computer world
To read or write a file, we open a stream connected to the file and access the data through the stream
Streams are used for reading and writing data into and from devices
Streams are ordered sequences of bytes
Provide consecutive access to its elements
Different types of streams are available to access different data sources:
File access, network access, memory streams and others
Streams are open before using them and closed after that
