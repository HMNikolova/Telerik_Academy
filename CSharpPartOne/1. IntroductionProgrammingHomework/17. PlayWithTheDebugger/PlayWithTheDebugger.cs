/*17.* Play with the Debugger in Visual Studio
 * Write a program that prints at the console the numbers from 1 to 1000, each at a separate line.
 * You might need to learn how to use loops (search in Internet).
 * Set a breakpoint in the line, which prints the next number in the Visual Studio code editor. 
 * Run the program through the debugger using the [F5] key. When the debugger stops at the breakpoint trace the code execution with [F10] key.
 * You do not have to submit anything in your homework for this problem. Just play with the debugger to learn how it works.
