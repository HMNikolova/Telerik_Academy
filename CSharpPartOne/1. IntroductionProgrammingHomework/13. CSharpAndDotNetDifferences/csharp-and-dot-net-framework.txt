Write your description in a text file called “csharp-and-dot-net-framework.txt”. Use English.
*/

C# is a programming language, .NET is a blanket term that tends to cover both the .NET Framework (an application framework library)
and the Common Language Runtime which is the runtime in which .NET assemblies are run.

.NET isn’t just a library, but also a runtime for executing applications.
The knowledge of C# implies some knowledge of .NET (because the C# object model corresponds to the .NET object model
and you can do anything interesting in C# just by using .NET libraries). The opposite isn’t necessarily true as you can use other languages
to write .NET applications.
The distinction between a langauge and runtime and library is more strict in .NET/C# than for example in C++,
where the language specification also includes some basic library functions.

C# is a language. but .NET is a framework. Framework means it contained different applications.
Some Name of the applications are Consule Application,Windows Applications,csharp Web Applications. .NET Framework is supports morethan 20 languages.
It’s a main difference between .NET and other languages. Like C#,VB,..etc.
